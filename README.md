# Search Engine

Built as part of the coursework for MSCI 541: Information Retrieval Systems.

First clone the repo:

`git clone git@github.com:krishnr/search-engine.git`

Then run `python search.py` to run the search engine. It will take a few seconds to load the index into memory before it prompts you for a query.

The code building up to the search engine can be found in the `Assignments` folder.
